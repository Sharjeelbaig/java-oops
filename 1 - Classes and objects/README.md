We use objects, which is an instance of a class, while a class is used which is a blueprint of an object.
</h2> <b> Confused, right!? Please follow along, so you may get a better understanding of classes and objects. </b>

<br />
<br />
<p> We can understand classes and objects by a real world example:</p>
<p>Think of class as any company, for instance it is "GMC", now our class "GMC" has several different objects, these are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Envoy</li>
<li>Sierra</li>
<li>Yukon</li>
</ul>
